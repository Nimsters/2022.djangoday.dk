In Django applications, models provide the interface for accessing relational data.

But the boss in accessing relational data is SQL. ORMs came later. In fact SQL first appeared in 1974!

This talk shows how thinking in SQL first can result in very efficient data access in Django.

And how the Django ORM provides all the tools needed for this code to be easy to read and maintain.

To get more background for the talk, refer to Joseph's blog post [Retrieving related data in Django](https://www.untangled.dev/2020/11/01/django-query-m2m-data/).
